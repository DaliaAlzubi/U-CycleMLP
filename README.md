# U-CycleMLP: Medical Image Segmentation
We seek to develop a new segmentation model based on Cycle MLP with a U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation. Our goal is to leverage the strengths of Cycle MLP's multi-scale feature learning and spatial information fusion capabilities to improve segmentation accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging applications.


Objectives:
To outperform existing baseline methods in medical image segmentation.
To provide a robust and efficient solution for medical professionals and researchers.
To contribute to the advancement of medical imaging technology through state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.
